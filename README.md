## Hey, I'm [Ansh Mehta]

<!-- [![Website Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-3b5998?style=flat-square&logo=google-chrome&logoColor=white)](https://ansh-mehta.com/) -->

I'm currently a graduate student in computer science, with minor in AI at Northeastern University. I was previously a software engineer at [Whatfix](https://whatfix.com/). 
I love to explore and always learn and implement. Going in-depth and understanding visually is the part I love the most in any topic I study. ✨

### Personal things about me :

- 💻 &nbsp; I love to learn and build.

- 🍕 &nbsp; Hackathons are my place, the environment and the thrill is something I enjoy. Here are few of my hackathons
	- DeveloperWeek 2024 - Winner [Submission](https://devpost.com/software/newsswipe)
	- MIT Energy Hackathon 2023 [a pic from the hack](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7135041556691988480/)
	- Whatfix Annual Hackathon
  	- HackwithInfy 2020 - Finalist 
  	- LNMHack 3.0 - Organizer [a pic](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1911691092201293&set=a.218384548198631)

- ✈️ &nbsp; Catching up with aviation and playing flight simulator are my freetime hobbies. I also play Cities Skylines 🏢 (just love building and see population thrive)		  


### Languages and Tools:

I can code in multiple languages, and never had a problem learning a new framework (give enough time and I think everyone can catch up). 
Though my primary languages are Python and Java. 
I also know quite a bit in detail about Javascript and Web engines (primarly due to my work-ex involving no-code analytics capture from any WEB PAGE - the complexities in that topic were huge!, i'm yet to write about it).
