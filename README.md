## Hey, I'm [Ansh Mehta]

<!-- [![Website Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-3b5998?style=flat-square&logo=google-chrome&logoColor=white)](https://ansh-mehta.com/) -->

I'm currently a graduate student in computer science, with minor in AI at Northeastern University. I was previously a software engineer at [Whatfix](https://whatfix.com/). 
I love to explore and always learn and implement. Going in-depth and understanding visually is the part I love the most in any topic I study. ‚ú®
